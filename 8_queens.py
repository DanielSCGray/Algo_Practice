# Build on previous solutions to write
# eightQueens()​. Return all arrangements of
# eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard, so that no
# queen threatens any other. What is the best way
# to return these results?
# Second:​ write a helper function that displays the
# results returned, using console.log().
