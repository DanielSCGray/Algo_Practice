# Rain Terraces
# A store wants to sell excess water so it landscapes its
# rooftop with a set of unusual elevated terraces. They are all the same width, but have varying heights.
# When it rains, water gathers in low terraces that are surrounded by taller ones. For example, if we have
# terraces with heights [3,1,1,4,2]â€‹, then as much as 4 units of water could be gathered, because
# water would pool 2-deep on two different terraces (both of the 1-high terraces: between the 3-high and
# 4-high terraces). Water on the other terraces just runs off. Given an array of terrace heights, return the
# maximum amount of water that is trapped when rains come.
